<h1>Hello World!<h1> 
<h2>I'm Brianne Petrone</h2>  
<p>Iâ€™m a video editor and digital media creator focused on producing evocative, intentional content with a meaningful impact. Pursuing a bachelor's degree in Media Arts & Design at James Madison University, with a concentration in Digital Video & Cinema, I have experience working with several startup companies, creating video content and digital marketing strategies.</p>

<p>Intentionality is at the heart of everything I create. I currently assist in the filming and editing of James Madison University's Branded Content for Recruitment Marketing. I'm also a contract video editor for client's promotional video needs.</p>

<p>Leaving others feeling provoked, introspective, seen, heard, and understood are my main objectives in any project I take on. Always creating or working on some form of content, I'm constantly honing my craft and seeking collaboration, challenge, and meaningful experience wherever I go.</p>
